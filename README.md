## Overview

Using Multiple Linear Regression and other forms of statistical analysis, we used these practices to create a real estate price predictor for homes in King County. We created models that would show what factors can influence the housing prices in the county. These prediction models can be used to help any transpants who are thinking about moving to the Seattle area.

## Purpose 

King County is one of the fastest growing counties in the United States. With the tech-boom and the growing influence of Seattle, the population and the interest of purchasing homes is increasing. We want to create a price predictor for any real estate companies, investors, or any other potential clients, and show what features could possibly raise or lower the prices of the homes in the county for purchasing reasons.

## Understanding the numbers


All of our data came from a csv dataset that was provided for us. The dataset contains thousands of detailed information of homes in the county ranging from square footage, bathrooms, bedrooms, and many other useful information. We had to dive into the data and do some data cleaning to make sure we were able to create our models. We were introduced to new tools, sklearn as well as use from the common tools we have used before:  pandas, numpy, seaborn, statsmodels, and matplotlib. All of these different tools were necessary in order for us to create a succesful model for this research.

## Models 

When working on this project, we used two different types of modeling: predictive modeling and inferential modeling.
