## Overview

Using Multiple Linear Regression and other forms of statistical analysis, we used these practices to create a real estate price predictor for homes in King County. We created models that would show what factors can influence the housing prices in the county. These prediction models can be used to help any investors who are thinking about expanding on their real estate portfolio.

MKT LLC has a prominent presence in the real estate market in the greater Seattle area, we can provide a competitive edge through our housing price prediction model and can steer you in the right direction for growth and profit


---------------
## Business Problem 
With the increase in population, the real estate market is on the rise which means there is a potential for capitalization in this growing market and we believe that our model can provide an edge in the competitive market.

## Understanding the numbers


All of our data came from a csv dataset that was provided for us from the county itself. The dataset contains thousands of detailed information of homes in the county ranging from square footage, bathrooms, bedrooms, and many other useful information. We had to dive into the data and do some data cleaning to make sure we were able to create our models. We were introduced to new tools, sklearn as well as use from the common tools we have used before:  pandas, numpy, seaborn, statsmodels, and matplotlib. All of these different tools were necessary in order for us to create a succesful model for this research. 

------
## Models 

When working on this project, we used two different types of modeling: predictive modeling and inferential modeling. 


### Inferential Models



### Predictive Models

Using the lowest error and the highest accuracy, predictive models are supposed to give us the most accurate model to predict our target. 

## Recommendations 
-------
We reccomend you explore these 3 points to consider for your benefit: 
- Use our model to accurately price the current inventory. 
- Use our model to find undervalued homes. 
- Use the model to find the best features to include in new home builds.
